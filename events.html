                <p>On June 10th 2024, participants got together to run a scenic 8k route through Leigh Woods in all manner of wacky costumes. 80 people participated in the run, and raised a total of over £2000!</p><br>
                <p>We held an absolutely rad Battle of the Bands event on July 15th 2023 at Tyntesfield Estate. Audience members were able to vote for their favourite band by donating money - and the band who raised the most funds was chosen as the winner. Of the 14 entrants, the fan favourite was the death metal group Skeleton Temple Crusade. The event raised over £2500.</p><br>
                <p>On January 5th 2023, 5 volunteers braved the freezing cold weather and took part in a charity skydive. They jumped out of a plane 10000 feet in the air! In spite of one of them hitting a seagull in their descent, everything went smoothly and the event raised over £2200.</p><br>
                <p>On March 16th, we held a charity cheese rolling event. Participants chased cheese wheels tumbling down Brandon Hill, and of course got to feast on delicious cheeses to replenish their energy afterwards. This event raised over £4000, and you'll brie cheesed to hear - sorry, pleased to hear - that over 50 people took part.</p><br>
                <p>Our charity Fortnite tournament, which ran from 12th-14th February 2024 at the HPE offices in Bristol, went down a storm. 100 skilled players dropped in, but only one, of course, could claim the win. The event raised over £5500 - in our books, that's an epic victory royale.</p><br>
                <p>The charity hot dog eating contest, held on August 29th 2023, cooked up a whopping £3500 in charity donations. It took place in Castle Park, and the winning participant managed to down 20 dogs in 2 minutes before passing out.</p><br>
